### ðŸ“‚ Project 3: Database Design for a Local Restaurant Chain

- Designed an inventory management system by building a data model with interlinked tables in Azure Database Studio and imported simulated data to ensure efficient data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.
- Developed SQL queries, triggers, and stored procedures to automate data updates after placing orders, generate reports on order costs and ingredient inventory, and trigger re-order alerts.
- Estimated to achieve a minimum 20% reduction in management time while effectively mitigating inventory shortages.
- Constructed an intuitive Microsoft PowerApps application tailored for managers, including branch information, inventory information, and automated order request forms.

### ðŸ“‚ Project 4: Credit Card Transactional Data Analysis | Python

This project was a collaborative effort focused on analyzing credit card transaction data, fraud patterns, and client behaviors across multiple integrated datasets.  
The following highlights my individual contributions, primarily focusing on data cleaning, client-level feature engineering, correlation analysis, and strategic business insight generation.

- Built a complete data analysis pipeline by merging transaction, fraud label, and card datasets into a unified dataframe for exploratory analysis and Cleaned and standardized the data.
- Conducted correlation analysis between average credit limit and total spending, identifying a moderate positive correlation (r = 0.4077).
- Detected and investigated an outlier client with a low credit limit but exceptionally high total spending, leading to deeper demographic and behavioral analysis.
- Visualized annual spending trends and card usage preferences using Holoviews and Bokeh, uncovering seasonal spending patterns and cross-sell opportunities.
- Generated actionable business insights, proposing targeted promotional strategies to enhance client loyalty and optimize credit line management.
