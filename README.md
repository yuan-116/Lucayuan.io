## -Project 3 Database Design for the local restaurant chain


â€¢ Designed an inventory management system by building a data model with interlinked tables in Azure Database Studio
and imported simulated data to ensure efficient data storage, retrieval, and manipulation

â€¢ Developed SQL queries, triggers, and stored procedures to automate update data after placing an order, generate reports of
the cost of order and ingredient inventory, and trigger re-order alerts for ingredients. Estimate to achieve a minimum 20%
reduction in management time while effectively mitigating inventory shortages

â€¢ Constructed an intuitive Microsoft PowerApps application tailored for managers, including branch information, inventory
information, automated filling of order request forms

### Other Projects

## Project 1: Machine Learning for Business | R

- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) including correlation analysis, descriptive statistics, scatter plot visualizations, and multicollinearity checks (VIF) to investigate feature relationships and trends across business and healthcare datasets.

- Cleaned and prepared structured datasets through normalization, dummy encoding, categorical target transformation, and applied dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, Factor Analysis, Correspondence Analysis, FAMD) to simplify features prior to modeling.

- Built and evaluated machine learning modelsâ€”including Neural Networks, XGBoost, Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, KNN, and NaÃ¯ve Bayesâ€”for regression and classification tasks.

- Applied models to real-world problems in energy efficiency forecasting, housing price estimation, product quality scoring, and disease risk prediction, aligning machine learning with business insights.

## Project 2: Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews | Python

- Built and compared multiple NLP pipelines using a labeled Rotten Tomatoes dataset to classify sentiment on short movie review phrases.  
- Engineered features including lemmatized Bag-of-Words, chi-squared bigrams, Subjectivity Lexicon, POS-tagged features, and LIWC-based sentiment scores.  
- Achieved best performance using a Random Forest classifier with 63.07% accuracy, outperforming baseline Naive Bayes models.  
- Evaluated models using k-fold cross-validation and F1-score, identifying challenges with feature compatibility and preprocessing trade-offs.
