## -Project 3 USDA Nutritional Data Warehouse â€“ Uncovering Trends in U.S. Food

- Migrated and cleaned over 100,000 food records from Microsoft Access to SQL Server using SSMA, ensuring data quality and consistency.

- Constructed a Bus Matrix to define analytical business processes and shared dimensions, then designed a star schema to support efficient querying.

- Developed ETL pipelines in SQL Server to automate the extraction, transformation, and loading of structured nutrient data.

- Conducted analysis on nutrient trends across food types (branded, foundation, survey), identified top nutrient-contributing brands, and evaluated changes over time.

- Built interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize nutrient density, brand impact, and top nutrient distributions for data-driven insights.

## -Project 4 Database Design for local restaurant chain


â€¢ Designed an inventory management system by building a data model with interlinked tables in Azure Database Studio
and imported simulated data to ensure efficient data storage, retrieval, and manipulation

â€¢ Developed SQL queries, triggers, and stored procedures to automate update data after placing an order, generate reports of
the cost of order and ingredient inventory, and trigger re-order alerts for ingredients. Estimate to achieve a minimum 20%
reduction in management time while effectively mitigating inventory shortages

â€¢ Constructed an intuitive Microsoft PowerApps application tailored for managers, including branch information, inventory
information, automated filling of order request forms

### Other Projects

## Project 1: Machine Learning for Business | R

- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) including correlation analysis, descriptive statistics, scatter plot visualizations, and multicollinearity checks (VIF) to investigate feature relationships and trends across business and healthcare datasets.

- Cleaned and prepared structured datasets through normalization, dummy encoding, categorical target transformation, and applied dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, Factor Analysis, Correspondence Analysis, FAMD) to simplify features prior to modeling.

- Built and evaluated machine learning modelsâ€”including Neural Networks, XGBoost, Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, KNN, and NaÃ¯ve Bayesâ€”for regression and classification tasks.

- Applied models to real-world problems in energy efficiency forecasting, housing price estimation, product quality scoring, and disease risk prediction, aligning machine learning with business insights.

## Project 2: Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews | Python

â€¢ Pre-processed text data with tokenization, lowercasing, stop-word removal, and lemmatization improve consistency.

â€¢ Developed a NaÃ¯ve Bayes Classifier with Bag-of-Words features, achieving a baseline accuracy of 56.73%.

â€¢ Engineered advanced features, including bi-grams, POS tagging, SubjectivityLexicon (SL), and Linguistic Inquiry and
Word Count (LIWC), leading to a best NaÃ¯ve Bayes accuracy of 57.6%.

â€¢ Integrated a Random Forest Classifier, improving accuracy to 63.07%

â€¢ Applied k-fold cross-validation to ensure model reliability and evaluated performance using F1-score.
